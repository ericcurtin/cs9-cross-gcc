# cs9-cross-gcc

This provides a containerized environment for cross compiling aarch64 applications for CentOS Stream 9 on an x86_64 machine. Tested with podman (but should work with docker I guess).

This is not an endorsed environment by any means, it works on a best effort basis, to get a truely nit free best experience free from bugs, please compile on a "normal" aarch64 platform when the target platform is aarch64.
